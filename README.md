### In the Backend
##### there is a Node JS and Express JS Server.
##### and I also used Socket IO for getting ROOM ID and USER NAME.
##### User can post the data from frontend and our backend server get that data and proceed to the next step.
##### bcox of Socket IO it is easy to build this app.
##### Once, Two user can comes in a same ROOM ID, then they can chat with each other.
##### It has a completely mobile responsive design.
